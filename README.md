# Machine-Learning-A-Probabilistic-Perspective-Solutions

## Motivation

Hey there. I am recording the solutions of the exercises of the **fourth printing** of this book in this repository. The only exercises that I do not intend to do in this first run are those which explicit require MATLAB. Any computational exercise will be done in Python using a Jupyter notebook. I will follow a schema where I give a introduction and some insight into the problem, solve it and then make some remarks on the solution. I strongly reccomend the reading of the Intro and Conclusion section of the exercises that you're interested in. I intend to update the solutions in a reasonable pace, starting now (January 2017). 

I hope this might help anyone who has an interest in the book and Machine Learning as a whole. If you have any question, want to debate about the book, or think that some solution may be wrong or could be improved, feel free to send me an e-mail at: arthurzc23@gmail.com.

## Updates (20/03/2017)

Hello guys, I am finally back. During my break some people contacted me about the future of the repository and I want to share with all what I've told them. The repository goal is to give a solution manual for the **whole book**. I believe this semester I will finish Chapters 4, 5, 6 and maybe 7. I will try to post the exercises more frequently, but keep in mind that this is not my main priority at the moment. 

## New decisions

* As I read the book, I am facing new concepts that were useful to explain questions of previous chapters. However, due to time constraints, I do not intend to update the exercises with those new insights in the near future, save extraordinary cases.

## About the author

I am a brazilian Electrical Engineer graduated at Unicamp, one the most prestigious universities in my country.
I graduated as the best student of my class in 2016, among other honors. Currently, I am a M.S. student on the Electrical Engineering program at the same University, where I intend to use machine learning in agriculture and food/beverage problems.
